Hello, in this updated application, there is bidirectional communication, meaning messaging, between Discord and the AOS terminal in the Getting-Started channel of the AOS community's global chat interface.

To test this, when you open the AOS terminal, type the following commands in order:

`.load-blueprint chat`

`.load /root/fatih/chatroom.lua`

`Join("Getting-Started")`

`Say("test", "Getting-Started")`

You can change the content of the message in step 4 as you wish. Then you will see the message you wrote on the AOS terminal in my Discord channel. Likewise, any message written by a user in the Discord channel will be transferred to the AOS terminal. Please observe this.
